# HIC15- Punch Sensor

Once your punch or kick lands on an opponent's head, how the kinetic energy is transferred determines how much damage is done. I use the Head Injury Criteria (HIC15) from car crash data to make a sensor to teach fighters to maximize the damage and energy efficiency of their strikes.
